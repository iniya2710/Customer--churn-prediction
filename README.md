Customer churn is a key business concept that determines the number of customers that stop doing business with a specific company. The churn rate is then defined as the rate by which a company loses customers in a given time frame. For example, a churn rate of 15%/year means that a company loses 15% of its total customer base every year. Customer churn takes special importance in the telecommunication sector, given the increasing competition and appearance of new telecommunication companies. For this reason, the telecom industry expects high churn rates every year.
In this project I used telecom customer churn dataset to build a Artificial Neural Network model for Churn analysis.
